# Kumbh-mela
Har Har Gange! ðŸŒŠ<br>
An Online booking and management web-app created using PHP and MySql.<br>
<br>
<p>Requirement : Kumbh Mela is the largest festival celebrated in India in every 12 years with an average footfall of
4M! With such a humongous congregation of pilgrims and worshippers, it becomes important to have a proper,
robust management system to handle such a big festival.</p>
<br>
<p>Planning : We have planned to create a system where the user would be allotted a Ghat. The Ghat allotment is
done intelligently by providing a ghat with less number of people to avoid congestion. We have created a separate
ordering system where a user can order Prashad and many more even if he is not attending the Mela.</p>
<br>
<p>Design : The Backend was designed using Mysql (Database) along with PHPmyadmin and the frontend was
designed by using basic HTML and CSS.</p>
<br>
<p>Deployment : The app currently works locally but we have planned on deploying it to Heroku or Netlify.</p>
